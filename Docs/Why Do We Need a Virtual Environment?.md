1. **Dependency Conflicts**: Without a virtual environment, Django and any other Python packages will be installed globally on your system. This can cause conflicts with other projects that might require different package versions. For instance, if one project needs Django 3.2 and another needs Django 4.0, installing both globally can lead to incompatibility issues.
    
2. **Difficulties in Managing Dependencies**: A virtual environment allows each project to have its own `requirements.txt` file, listing only the dependencies specific to that project. Without it, managing and replicating project environments on other machines (like teammates' laptops) becomes more challenging.
    
3. **Risk of Unintended Changes**: Installing packages globally increases the chance of accidentally upgrading or removing packages that other projects rely on, leading to unexpected behavior across projects.
    
4. **Collaboration Challenges**: With a virtual environment, everyone on the team can install the exact same dependencies and versions. If skipped, teammates might encounter version mismatches and face additional setup work to align their local environments.
