## **Web Application Development Plan for the Tree Map Project**

This plan focuses on building a web application that facilitates data collection and visualization to help users easily access and understand the ecological value of trees, aligning with the Tree Map projectâ€™s objectives.

## 1. Overview and Goal Setting
- **Goal**: To collect and visualize data on trees within the campus to understand their ecological value and, in the long term, expand the map to include tree data for Cupertino and the entire Bay Area.
- **Feature Summary**: Data collection, tree location mapping, and dashboard to provide ecological information for each tree.

## 2. Key Feature Definitions
1. **User Interface (UI/UX) Design**
    - Design a user-friendly interface (including map and dashboard).
    - Allow users to easily view, add, or edit tree data.
    - Provide an intuitive map and dashboard to help users visually understand the location, type, and ecological value of each tree.
2. **Data Collection Feature**
    - In addition to Google Forms, enable tree data input within the web application.
    - Collect various data fields, such as tree species, location, size, etc.
    - Add validation features to ensure data accuracy (e.g., required fields check, duplicate data prevention).
3. **Data Visualization Feature**
    - **Tree Map**: Display campus tree locations on a map, with detailed information accessible on-click.
    - **Dashboard**: Visualize ecological value metrics (e.g., carbon reduction, energy conservation, air quality improvement).
    - Provide aggregation, filtering, and sorting functionalities on the dashboard.

## 3. Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Use Django (Python) to build the database and application logic.
- **Frontend**: Implement the basic interface with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
    - For map visualization, consider using Leaflet.js or Mapbox.
- **Database**: Use PostgreSQL or MySQL for data storage.
- **API**: If needed, integrate OpenTreeMap API or public data APIs for reference.

## 4. Development Stages
1. **Initial Setup and Environment Configuration**
    - Set up a GitHub repository and organize a collaborative development environment.
    - Set up local and cloud servers (distinguish between testing and deployment environments).
2. **Feature Development Stages**
    - **Database Model Design**: Design models to store tree species, location information, size, and ecological value.
    - **Data Input/Edit Feature Development**: Implement features to allow users to input and edit tree data.
    - **Map and Dashboard Visualization Development**: Develop functions to display tree locations on a map and visualize statistical information on the dashboard.
3. **Testing and Validation**
    - Conduct unit and integration tests for each feature.
    - Test various usage scenarios and gather user feedback.
4. **Final Deployment and Maintenance Plan**
    - After final deployment, optimize for user experience and performance.
    - Plan for regular data updates and ongoing feature improvements.
