To view the formatted appearance of a Markdown file, you can use these methods:

### 1. **Using a Markdown Editor**
- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**: This free editor allows you to open a `.md` file, right-click, and select "Open Preview to the Side" to see the formatted view. You can also press `Ctrl + Shift + V` (or `Cmd + Shift + V` on Mac) to open a preview pane.
- **Obsidian**: A Markdown-based note-taking app that supports both writing and preview modes.

### 2. **Viewing on GitHub**
- If you upload a Markdown file to GitHub, it will automatically display in a formatted view on the website.
